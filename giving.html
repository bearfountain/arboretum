        <p>We would like to expand our sponsored support for student research and educational activities as well as public walks in the Arboretum. Student projects include research involving the dynamics of the plants in the natural section of the Arboretum. We also have students leading tours and need to develop and produce Arboretum publications such as a new edition and printing of our pamphlet and brochures. Your contributions will help make these efforts a reality.</p>
        <p>In addition, we would like to provide community and regional lectures on native and horticultural topics as well as to hold various workshops. Lectures could be held as one-time events or your gift could endow, under your name, an annual lecture series.</p>
        <p>Please send us your ideas.</p>
        <p>If you have questions about contributing to the Arboretum please contact the Gina Scalise, Director, The Fund For Geneseo at (585) 245-5503 or drop her an email.</p>
